Use of AI in this project:

I worked on this project individually and used AI very minimally. I pretty much designed and implemented
all the code that was written for this assignment. I found that trying to engineer prompts to ChatGPT would
take longer than me just simply implmenting it on my own. Also, I find that AI tools are very useful for small
subtasks, however fail at generating larger program structure. Much of my code was already written from project 1
and could be significantly reused and reworked to fit the new requirements.

Overall, my use of AI was quite minimal, and I used more traditional mediums such as StackOverflow and traditional
code writing practices.
